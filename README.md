# Fast Food Explorer
The Fast Food Explorer is a Javascript web application aimed to help individuals decide **which fast food vendor is best suited for their current cravings**. Users can supply a general food, such as *nuggets*, and will be provided with all the fast food restaurants who serve some form of *nuggets* as well as the specific entree name, and calorie count of the entree. For each vendor, if there is a nearby store to the user, details on the nearest store will be provided.

It was originally built using the (now deprecated) USDA Food Data API, but has been updated to use the Nutritionix API and Foursquare.
